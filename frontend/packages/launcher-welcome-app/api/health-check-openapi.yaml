    summary: Health Check
    description: Health checks are HTTP endpoints that the codebase exposes for the
      purpose of monitoring. OpenShift will periodically hit these to determine that
      the container is functioning properly. If not, it may kill and/or restart the
      pod to maintain the targeted number of instances configured to be running.

      summary: Liveness check
      description: |-
        Many applications running for long periods of time eventually transition to broken states, and cannot recover except by being restarted. Kubernetes provides liveness probes to detect and remedy such situations.
